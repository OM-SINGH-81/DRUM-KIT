**LETS MAKE SOME NOISE! 🎶**  
This is a simple interactive drum kit website that allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on the drum buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.  
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including custom drum button designs and animations.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling user interactions and playing audio.

## 📘 What I Learned from This Project
- **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting and updating HTML elements with JavaScript.  
- **Event Handling:** Listening for clicks and keypresses to trigger actions.  
- **Audio Playback:** Using the `Audio` object to play sounds.  
- **CSS Animations:** Adding visual effects and transitions.  
- **JavaScript Basics:** Strengthened understanding of functions, loops, and `switch` statements.  
- **Project Structuring:** Organizing files cleanly for scalability and readability.
